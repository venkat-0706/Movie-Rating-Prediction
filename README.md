# 🎬 IMDb Movies India - Data Analysis and Rating Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling IMDb movie data specific to Indian cinema. It includes a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing techniques, and machine learning models to understand key factors that influence movie ratings and potentially predict them.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore the IMDb Indian movie dataset to uncover trends and patterns.
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict movie ratings or other numerical outcomes.
- Gain insights that can help film production houses, streaming platforms, or researchers.

## 📁 Dataset

**Name**: IMDb Movies India  
**Format**: CSV  
**Encoding**: `ISO-8859-1`

The dataset contains information such as:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Duration
- IMDb rating
- Language
- Release year
- Country
- Meta score
- Votes
- Gross collection

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data preview and inspection (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`)
- Checking missing values and data types
- Univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots
- Bivariate analysis using scatterplots and correlation heatmaps
- Outlier detection with z-score and boxplots

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- One-hot encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling using `MinMaxScaler`
- Splitting dataset into training and test sets

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented the following models:

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Logistic Regression** *(used creatively for classification-like interpretation)*
- **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning

### 🔍 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**
- **Feature Importance**
- **Residual Analysis**

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved strong predictive accuracy with ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Identified top contributing features to IMDb ratings such as:
  - `Meta score`
  - `Votes`
  - `Gross`
  - `Duration`
